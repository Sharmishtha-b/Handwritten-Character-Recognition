# Handwritten Character Recognition with Neural Network

The goal of this project is to develop a handwritten character recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The implementation is done in Python using various libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow. The implemented CNN model demonstrates accurate predictions on both the provided dataset and external images.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

Recognizing handwritten forms is a critical step in various applications, and to achieve accurate recognition, a substantial amount of training data is required. The dataset provided here addresses the need for handwritten character recognition, serving as a valuable resource for training machine learning models. The dataset comprises 26 folders, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet (A-Z). Within each folder, there are handwritten images, and each image is of size 28x28 pixels. The alphabets in the images are centered and fitted into a 20x20 pixel box.

<h2>Required frameworks:</h2>
+ NumPy (v1.16.5)
+ OpenCV (cv2) (v3.4.2)
+ Keras (v2.3.1)
+ TensorFlow (v2.0.0)
+ Matplotlib (v3.1.1)
+ Pandas (v0.25.1)

<h2>Implementation</h2>
+ Reading and Preprocessing the Data
+ Data Shuffling and Reshaping
+ Label Categorization
+ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
+ Model Evaluation
+ Prediction on Test Data
+ Prediction on External Image
